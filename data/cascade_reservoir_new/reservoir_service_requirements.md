The companion CSV transcribes only the guaranteed-output and ecological-flow
columns from that table. The source identity and table locator are retained in
each row. These values are recorded as reported in the paper.

| Repository ID | Paper ID | Guaranteed output (MW) | Ecological flow (m³/s) |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| WDD | WDD | 2290.0 | 900.0 |
| BHT | BHT | 4567.5 | 1160.0 |
| XLD | XLD | 5345.7 | 1160.0 |
| XJB | XJB | 2750.0 | 1200.0 |
| THR | TGR | 4990.0 | 6000.0 |

## Interpretation

- Each threshold is constant across days and years, matching the paper's fixed
  experimental requirements. Flood-season dates and hard seasonal bounds remain
  separate inputs.
- Guaranteed output is power in MW, not energy in MWh. In the daily simulator it
  will be compared with actual daily mean power; a shortfall energy is the MW
  shortfall multiplied by the step length in hours.
- Ecological flow is the mean total release at the reservoir outlet in m³/s,
  including turbine discharge and spill. It is not an inflow, turbine-only flow,
  or downstream-gauge measurement. Deficit volume is the flow shortfall
  multiplied by the step length in seconds.
- The paper's TGR means Three Gorges Reservoir, called THR in this repository.
  Both identifiers are kept so that the mapping is explicit.
- The loader accepts a nonnegative threshold; zero explicitly means that the
  corresponding requirement is inactive. Every requirement supplied here is
  positive. Later reward calculations must handle inactive requirements without
  division by zero.

## Reward use

`load_service_requirements: true` loads and validates this table even when
reward penalties are disabled. Enabling the penalties also requires loading the
table. Its SHA-256 and provenance appear in startup, episode, and evaluation
metadata. No other column of the paper's Table A.1 is imported.

The shared daily reward is cascade energy divided by maximum daily cascade
energy, minus two weighted averages of relative shortfalls. Each shortfall is
`max(requirement - actual, 0) / requirement`, averaged over that term's fixed
positive-requirement set. Both weights default to 1.0; they are explicit
tradeoffs, not calibrated costs. The old target-band and daily level rise/fall
penalties have been removed. This follows the paper's relative-deficit penalty
form while retaining the repository's common team objective, rather than
reproducing the paper's entire local/global reward mixture.

For the current five positive requirements, generation is in [0,1], each mean
relative shortfall is in [0,1], and the unit-weight daily reward is in [-2,1].
Negative rewards are retained. A relative tolerance of 1e-10 excludes floating
point roundoff from both costs and shortfall counts. All reward components use
the same training discount, currently gamma=0.99; physical compliance rates,
shortfall energy, and deficit volumes are never discounted. A cascade sum of
ecological deficits is a sum over outlet service requirements, not unique
missing water volume in the basin.

Hydraulics, hard seasonal bounds, actor and critic observations, and HAPPO
updates are unchanged. These requirements are soft penalties, so compliance is
measured rather than guaranteed by an added hard lower bound.

The loader checks one row per reservoir, units through named columns, finite
nonnegative thresholds, guaranteed output no larger than the configured
installed capacity, and ecological flow no larger than the total release
capacity. These capacity checks are necessary consistency checks; they do not
assert that every daily requirement is achievable under every inflow and
storage condition.
